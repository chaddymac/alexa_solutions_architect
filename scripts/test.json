        "explanation": "<p>An <strong>Auto Scaling group</strong> contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies. Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service. The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired capacity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling.</p><p>Step scaling policies and simple scaling policies are two of the dynamic scaling options available for you to use. Both require you to create CloudWatch alarms for the scaling policies. Both require you to specify the high and low thresholds for the alarms. Both require you to define whether to add or remove instances, and how many, or set the group to an exact size. The main difference between the policy types is the step adjustments that you get with step scaling policies. When step adjustments are applied, and they increase or decrease the current capacity of your Auto Scaling group, the adjustments vary based on the size of the alarm breach.</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/images/as-basic-diagram.png\"></p><p>The primary issue with simple scaling is that after a scaling activity is started, the policy must wait for the scaling activity or health check replacement to complete and the cooldown period to expire before responding to additional alarms. Cooldown periods help to prevent the initiation of additional scaling activities before the effects of previous activities are visible.</p><p>With a target tracking scaling policy, you can increase or decrease the current capacity of the group based on a target value for a specific metric. This policy will help resolve the over-provisioning of your resources. The scaling policy adds or removes capacity as required to keep the metric at, or close to, the specified target value. In addition to keeping the metric close to the target value, a target tracking scaling policy also adjusts to changes in the metric due to a changing load pattern.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is:<strong> Use target tracking scaling.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use simple scaling </strong>is incorrect because you need to wait for the cooldown period to complete before initiating additional scaling activities. Target tracking or step scaling policies can trigger a scaling activity immediately without waiting for the cooldown period to expire.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use scheduled scaling</strong> is incorrect because this policy is mainly used for predictable traffic patterns. You need to use the target tracking scaling policy to optimize the cost of your infrastructure without affecting the performance.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use suspend and resume scaling</strong> is incorrect because this type is used to temporarily pause scaling activities triggered by your scaling policies and scheduled actions.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-target-tracking.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-scaling-target-tracking.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/AutoScalingGroup.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this AWS Auto Scaling Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-auto-scaling/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-auto-scaling/</a></p>",

To enable client-side encryption, you have the following options:</p><p>- Use an AWS KMS-managed customer master key.</p><p>- Use a client-side master key.</p><p><br></p><p>When using an AWS KMS-managed customer master key to enable client-side data encryption, you provide an AWS KMS customer master key ID (CMK ID) to AWS. On the other hand, when you use client-side master key for client-side data encryption, your client-side master keys and your unencrypted data are never sent to AWS. It's important that you safely manage your encryption keys because if you lose them, you can't decrypt your data.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2014/s3_sse_customer_key_2.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>This is how client-side encryption using client-side master key works:</p><p><strong>When uploading an object</strong> - You provide a client-side master key to the Amazon S3 encryption client. The client uses the master key only to encrypt the data encryption key that it generates randomly. The process works like this:</p><p>1. The Amazon S3 encryption client generates a one-time-use symmetric key (also known as a data encryption key or data key) locally. It uses the data key to encrypt the data of a single Amazon S3 object. The client generates a separate data key for each object.</p><p>2. The client encrypts the data encryption key using the master key that you provide. The client uploads the encrypted data key and its material description as part of the object metadata. The client uses the material description to determine which client-side master key to use for decryption.</p><p>3. The client uploads the encrypted data to Amazon S3 and saves the encrypted data key as object metadata (<code>x-amz-meta-x-amz-key</code>) in Amazon S3.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>When downloading an object - </strong>The client downloads the encrypted object from Amazon S3. Using the material description from the object's metadata, the client determines which master key to use to decrypt the data key. The client uses that master key to decrypt the data key and then uses the data key to decrypt the object.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is to <strong>use S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key</strong>.</p><p><strong>Using S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key</strong> is incorrect because in client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key, you provide an AWS KMS customer master key ID (CMK ID) to AWS. The scenario clearly indicates that both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS.</p><p><strong>Using S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key</strong> is incorrect because the scenario mentioned that the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS, which means that you have to use client-side encryption in order to encrypt the data first before sending to AWS. In this way, you can ensure that there is no unencrypted data being uploaded to AWS. In addition, the master key used by Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS–Managed Keys (SSE-KMS) is uploaded and managed by AWS, which directly violates the requirement of not uploading the master key.</p><p><strong>Using S3 server-side encryption with customer provided key</strong> is incorrect because just as mentioned above, you have to use client-side encryption in this scenario instead of server-side encryption. For the S3 server-side encryption with customer-provided key (SSE-C), you actually provide the encryption key as part of your request to upload the object to S3. Using this key, Amazon S3 manages both the encryption (as it writes to disks) and decryption (when you access your objects).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingEncryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingEncryption.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html</a></p>",

        "explanation": "<p>Before we proceed in answering this question, we must first be clear with the actual definition of a \"<strong>schema</strong>\". Basically, the english definition of a schema is: <em>a representation of a plan or theory in the form of an outline or model</em>.</p><p>Just think of a schema as the \"structure\" or a \"model\" of your data in your database. Since the scenario requires that the schema, or the structure of your data, changes frequently, then you have to pick a database which provides a non-rigid and flexible way of adding or removing new types of data. This is a classic example of choosing between a relational database and non-relational (NoSQL) database.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/2019-03-08_21-57-30-7860e883ac634eb2e771a5f4694cbafa.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>A relational database is known for having a rigid schema, with a lot of constraints and limits as to which (and what type of ) data can be inserted or not. It is primarily used for scenarios where you have to support complex queries which fetch data across a number of tables. It is best for scenarios where you have complex table relationships but for use cases where you need to have a flexible schema, this is not a suitable database to use.</p><p>For NoSQL, it is not as rigid as a relational database because you can easily add or remove rows or elements in your table/collection entry. It also has a more flexible schema because it can store complex hierarchical data within a single item which, unlike a relational database, does not entail changing multiple related tables. Hence, the best answer to be used here is a NoSQL database, like DynamoDB. When your business requires a low-latency response to high-traffic queries, taking advantage of a NoSQL system generally makes technical and economic sense.</p><p>Amazon DynamoDB helps solve the problems that limit the relational system scalability by avoiding them. In DynamoDB, you design your schema specifically to make the most common and important queries as fast and as inexpensive as possible. Your data structures are tailored to the specific requirements of your business use cases.</p><p>Remember that a relational database system <strong>does not scale</strong> well for the following reasons:</p><p>- It normalizes data and stores it on multiple tables that require multiple queries to write to disk.</p><p>- It generally incurs the performance costs of an ACID-compliant transaction system.</p><p>- It uses expensive joins to reassemble required views of query results.</p><p><br></p><p>For DynamoDB, it scales well due to these reasons:</p><p>- Its<strong> schema flexibility</strong> lets DynamoDB store complex hierarchical data within a single item. DynamoDB is not a totally <em>schemaless</em> database since the very definition of a schema is just the model or structure of your data.</p><p>- Composite key design lets it store related items close together on the same table.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>An Amazon RDS instance in Multi-AZ Deployments configuration</strong> and <strong>an Amazon Aurora database with Read Replicas</strong> are incorrect because both of them are a type of relational database.</p><p><strong>Redshift</strong> is incorrect because it is primarily used for OLAP systems.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-general-nosql-design.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-general-nosql-design.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-relational-modeling.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/bp-relational-modeling.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SQLtoNoSQL.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SQLtoNoSQL.html</a></p><p><br></p><p>Also check the <strong><em>AWS Certified Solutions Architect Official Study Guide: Associate Exam</em></strong> 1st Edition and turn to page 161 which talks about NoSQL Databases.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon DynamoDB Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-dynamodb/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-dynamodb/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Tutorials Dojo's AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam Study Guide:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/</a></p>",

An Aurora Serverless DB cluster is a DB cluster that automatically starts up, shuts down, and scales up or down its compute capacity based on your application's needs. Aurora Serverless provides a relatively simple, cost-effective option for infrequent, intermittent, sporadic or unpredictable workloads. It can provide this because it automatically starts up, scales compute capacity to match your application's usage and shuts down when it's not in use.</p><p>Take note that a non-Serverless DB cluster for Aurora is called a provisioned DB cluster. Aurora Serverless clusters and provisioned clusters both have the same kind of high-capacity, distributed, and highly available storage volume.</p><p>When you work with Amazon Aurora without Aurora Serverless (provisioned DB clusters), you can choose your DB instance class size and create Aurora Replicas to increase read throughput. If your workload changes, you can modify the DB instance class size and change the number of Aurora Replicas. This model works well when the database workload is predictable, because you can adjust capacity manually based on the expected workload.</p><p>However, in some environments, workloads can be intermittent and unpredictable. There can be periods of heavy workloads that might last only a few minutes or hours, and also long periods of light activity, or even no activity. Some examples are retail websites with intermittent sales events, reporting databases that produce reports when needed, development and testing environments, and new applications with uncertain requirements. In these cases and many others, it can be difficult to configure the correct capacity at the right times.

You set the minimum and maximum capacity. With Aurora Serverless, the database endpoint connects to a<em> proxy fleet </em>that routes the workload to a fleet of resources that are automatically scaled. Because of the proxy fleet, connections are continuous as Aurora Serverless scales the resources automatically based on the minimum and maximum capacity specifications. Database client applications don't need to change to use the proxy fleet. Aurora Serverless manages the connections automatically. Scaling is rapid because it uses a pool of \"warm\" resources that are always ready to service requests. Storage and processing are separate, so you can scale down to zero processing and pay only for storage.</p><p>Aurora Serverless introduces a new <code>serverless</code> DB engine mode for Aurora DB clusters. Non-Serverless DB clusters use the <code>provisioned</code> DB engine mode.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong><em>Launch an Amazon Aurora Serverless DB cluster then set the minimum and maximum capacity for the cluster</em>.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Launch an Amazon Aurora Provisioned DB cluster with burstable performance DB instance class types</em></strong> is incorrect because an Aurora Provisioned DB cluster is not suitable for intermittent, sporadic, and unpredictable transactional workloads. This model works well when the database workload is predictable because you can adjust capacity manually based on the expected workload. A better database setup here is to use an Amazon Aurora Serverless cluster.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Launch a DynamoDB Global table with Auto Scaling enabled</em></strong> is incorrect because although it is using Auto Scaling, the scenario explicitly indicated that you need a relational database to handle your transactional workloads. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database and is not suitable for this use case. Moreover, the use of a DynamoDB Global table is not warranted since this is primarily used if you need a fully managed, multi-region, and multi-master database that provides fast, local, read and write performance for massively scaled, global applications.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Launch an Amazon Redshift data warehouse cluster with Concurrency Scaling</em></strong> is incorrect because this type of database is primarily used for online analytical processing (OLAP) and not for online transactional processing (OLTP).

        "question": "<p>A company is using Amazon S3 to store frequently accessed data. When an object is created or deleted, the S3 bucket will send an event notification to the Amazon SQS queue.

        "feedbacks": ["", "", "", ""],
        "explanation": "<p>The <strong>Amazon S3</strong> notification feature enables you to receive notifications when certain events happen in your bucket. To enable notifications, you must first add a notification configuration that identifies the events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destinations where you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications. You store this configuration in the notification subresource that is associated with a bucket.</p><p>Amazon S3 supports the following destinations where it can publish events:</p><p>- Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic</p><p>- Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue</p><p>- AWS Lambda</p><p>In Amazon SNS, the&nbsp;<em>fanout</em>&nbsp;scenario is when a message published to an SNS topic is replicated and pushed to multiple endpoints, such as Amazon SQS queues, HTTP(S) endpoints, and Lambda functions. This allows for parallel asynchronous processing.</p><p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2017/11/16/event_driven_sns_compute_slide05.png\"></p><p>For example, you can develop an application that publishes a message to an SNS topic whenever an order is placed for a product. Then, SQS queues that are subscribed to the SNS topic receive identical notifications for the new order. An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) server instance attached to one of the SQS queues can handle the processing or fulfillment of the order. And you can attach another Amazon EC2 server instance to a data warehouse for analysis of all orders received.</p><p>Based on the given scenario, the existing setup sends the event notification to an SQS queue. Since you need to send the notification to the development and operations team, you can use a combination of Amazon SNS and SQS. By using the message fanout pattern, you can create a topic and use two Amazon SQS queues to subscribe to the topic. If Amazon SNS receives an event notification, it will publish the message to both subscribers.</p><p>Take note that Amazon S3 event notifications are designed to be delivered at least once and to one destination only. You cannot attach two or more SNS topics or SQS queues for S3 event notification. Therefore, you must send the event notification to Amazon SNS.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is:<strong> Create an Amazon SNS topic and configure two Amazon SQS queues to subscribe to the topic. Grant Amazon S3 permission to send notifications to Amazon SNS and update the bucket to use the new SNS topic.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Set up another Amazon SQS queue for the other team. Grant Amazon S3 permission to send a notification to the second SQS queue&nbsp;</strong>is incorrect because you can only add 1 SQS or SNS at a time for Amazon S3 events notification. If you need to send the events to multiple subscribers, you should implement a message fanout pattern with Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS.</p><p>The option that says:<strong>&nbsp;Create a new Amazon SNS FIFO topic for the other team. Grant Amazon S3 permission to send the notification to the second SNS topic&nbsp;</strong>is incorrect because just as mentioned in the previous option, you can only add 1 SQS or SNS at a time for Amazon S3 events notification. In addition, neither Amazon SNS FIFO topic nor Amazon SQS FIFO queue is warranted in this scenario. Both of them can be used together to provide strict message ordering and message deduplication. The FIFO capabilities of each of these services work together to act as a fully managed service to integrate distributed applications that require data consistency in near-real-time.</p><p>The option that says:<strong>&nbsp;Set up an Amazon SNS topic and configure two Amazon SQS queues to poll the SNS topic. Grant Amazon S3 permission to send notifications to Amazon SNS and update the bucket to use the new SNS topic&nbsp;</strong>is incorrect because you can't poll Amazon SNS. Instead of configuring queues to poll Amazon SNS, you should configure each Amazon SQS queue to subscribe to the SNS topic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>References: </strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ways-to-add-notification-config-to-bucket.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ways-to-add-notification-config-to-bucket.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html#notification-how-to-overview\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html#notification-how-to-overview</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/welcome.html</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p>",

By using SAML, you can simplify the process of configuring federation with AWS, because you can use the IdP's service instead of writing custom identity proxy code.</p><p>Before you can use SAML 2.0-based federation as described in the preceding scenario and diagram, you must configure your organization's IdP and your AWS account to trust each other.

        "feedbacks": ["", "", "", ""],
        "explanation": "<p><strong>AWS Lambda</strong> lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. Just upload your code, and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.</p><p>The first time you invoke your function, AWS Lambda creates an instance of the function and runs its handler method to process the event. When the function returns a response, it stays active and waits to process additional events. If you invoke the function again while the first event is being processed, Lambda initializes another instance, and the function processes the two events concurrently. As more events come in, Lambda routes them to available instances and creates new instances as needed. When the number of requests decreases, Lambda stops unused instances to free up the scaling capacity for other functions.</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/images/features-scaling.png\"></p><p>Your functions' <em>concurrency</em> is the number of instances that serve requests at a given time. For an initial burst of traffic, your functions' cumulative concurrency in a Region can reach an initial level of between 500 and 3000, which varies per Region.</p><p>Based on the given scenario, you need to create a solution that will satisfy the two requirements. The first requirement is to create a solution that will allow the users to access the data using an API. To implement this solution, you can use Amazon API Gateway. The second requirement is to handle the burst of traffic within seconds. You should use AWS Lambda in this scenario because Lambda functions can absorb reasonable bursts of traffic for approximately 15-30 minutes.</p><p>Lambda can scale faster than the regular Auto Scaling feature of Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, or Amazon ECS. This is because AWS Lambda is more lightweight than other computing services. Under the hood, Lambda can run your code to thousands of available AWS-managed EC2 instances (that could already be running) within seconds to accommodate traffic. This is faster than the Auto Scaling process of launching new EC2 instances that could take a few minutes or so. An alternative is to overprovision your compute capacity but that will incur significant costs. The best option to implement given the requirements is a combination of AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is:<strong> Create an API using Amazon API Gateway and use AWS Lambda to handle the bursts of traffic.</strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Create an API using Amazon API Gateway and use the Amazon ECS cluster with Service Auto Scaling to handle the bursts of traffic in seconds </strong>is incorrect.

Temporary credentials are useful in scenarios that involve identity federation, delegation, cross-account access, and IAM roles. In this example, it is called <strong>enterprise identity federation</strong> considering that you also need to set up a single sign-on (SSO) capability.</p><p>The correct answers are:</p><p><strong><em>- Setup a Federation proxy or an Identity provider</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>- Setup an AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary tokens</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>- Configure an IAM role and an IAM Policy to access the bucket.</em></strong></p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/images/saml-based-federation.diagram.png\">In an enterprise identity federation, you can authenticate users in your organization's network, and then provide those users access to AWS without creating new AWS identities for them and requiring them to sign in with a separate user name and password. This is known as the <em>single sign-on</em> (SSO) approach to temporary access. AWS STS supports open standards like Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0, with which you can use Microsoft AD FS to leverage your Microsoft Active Directory. You can also use SAML 2.0 to manage your own solution for federating user identities.</p><p><strong><em>Using 3rd party Single Sign-On solutions such as Atlassian Crowd, OKTA, OneLogin and many others</em> </strong>is incorrect since you don't have to use 3rd party solutions to provide the access. AWS already provides the necessary tools that you can use in this situation.</p><p><strong><em>Mapping each individual user to a designated user folder in S3 using Amazon WorkDocs to access their personal documents</em></strong> is incorrect as there is no direct way of integrating Amazon S3 with Amazon WorkDocs for this particular scenario. Amazon WorkDocs is simply a fully managed, secure content creation, storage, and collaboration service. With Amazon WorkDocs, you can easily create, edit, and share content. And because it’s stored centrally on AWS, you can access it from anywhere on any device.</p><p><strong><em>Setting up a matching IAM user for each of the 1200 users in your corporate directory that needs access to a folder in the S3 bucket</em></strong> is incorrect since creating that many IAM users would be unnecessary.

CloudTrail events provide a history of both API and non-API account activity made through the AWS Management Console, AWS SDKs, command-line tools, and other AWS services. There are two types of events that can be logged in CloudTrail: management events and data events. By default, trails log management events, but not data events.</p><p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2015/cloudtrail_all_regions_main_screen_turn_on_1.png\"></p><p>A trail can be applied to all regions or a single region. As a best practice, create a trail that applies to all regions in the AWS partition in which you are working. This is the default setting when you create a trail in the CloudTrail console.</p><p>For most services, events are recorded in the region where the action occurred. For global services such as AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), AWS STS, Amazon CloudFront, and Route 53, events are delivered to any trail that includes global services, and are logged as occurring in US East (N. Virginia) Region.</p><p>In this scenario, the company requires a secure and durable logging solution that will track all of the activities of all AWS resources in all regions. CloudTrail can be used for this case with multi-region trail enabled, however, it will only cover the activities of the regional services (EC2, S3, RDS etc.) and not for global services such as IAM, CloudFront, AWS WAF, and Route 53. In order to satisfy the requirement, you have to add the <code>--include-global-service-events</code> parameter in your AWS CLI command.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Set up a new CloudTrail trail in a new S3 bucket using the AWS CLI and also pass both the </strong><code><strong>--is-multi-region-trail</strong></code><strong> and </strong><code><strong>--include-global-service-events</strong></code><strong> parameters then encrypt log files using KMS encryption.

When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoDB captures information about every modification to data items in the table.</p><p>Whenever an application creates, updates, or deletes items in the table, DynamoDB Streams writes a stream record with the primary key attribute(s) of the items that were modified. A <em>stream record </em>contains information about a data modification to a single item in a DynamoDB table.

Hence, <strong>enabling throttling limits and result caching in API Gateway</strong> is the correct answer.</p><p>You can add caching to API calls by provisioning an Amazon API Gateway cache and specifying its size in gigabytes. The cache is provisioned for a specific stage of your APIs. This improves performance and reduces the traffic sent to your back end. Cache settings allow you to control the way the cache key is built and the time-to-live (TTL) of the data stored for each method. Amazon API Gateway also exposes management APIs that help you invalidate the cache for each stage.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/1b6453892473a467d07372d45eb05abc2031647a/2018/09/26/api-gw-settings.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>The option that says: <strong>Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling</strong> is incorrect since there is no need to transfer your applications to other services.</p><p><strong>Using CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act as a cache</strong> is incorrect because CloudFront only speeds up content delivery which provides a better latency experience for your users.

A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, AWS Organizations SCPs, ACLs, and session policies.</p><p>IAM policies define permissions for action regardless of the method that you use to perform the operation. For example, if a policy allows the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/APIReference/API_GetUser.html\">GetUser</a> action, then a user with that policy can get user information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API.

When you connect to an Aurora cluster, the host name and port that you specify point to an intermediate handler called an <em>endpoint</em>. Aurora uses the endpoint mechanism to abstract these connections. Thus, you don't have to hardcode all the hostnames or write your own logic for load-balancing and rerouting connections when some DB instances aren't available.</p><p>For certain Aurora tasks, different instances or groups of instances perform different roles. For example, the primary instance handles all data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements.

For example, to perform DDL statements you can connect to whichever instance is the primary instance. To perform queries, you can connect to the reader endpoint, with Aurora automatically performing load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas. For clusters with DB instances of different capacities or configurations, you can connect to custom endpoints associated with different subsets of DB instances. For diagnosis or tuning, you can connect to a specific instance endpoint to examine details about a specific DB instance.</p><p>The custom endpoint provides load-balanced database connections based on criteria other than the read-only or read-write capability of the DB instances. For example, you might define a custom endpoint to connect to instances that use a particular AWS instance class or a particular DB parameter group. Then you might tell particular groups of users about this custom endpoint. For example, you might direct internal users to low-capacity instances for report generation or ad hoc (one-time) querying, and direct production traffic to high-capacity instances. Hence, <strong>creating a custom endpoint in Aurora based on the specified criteria for the production traffic and another custom endpoint to handle the reporting queries</strong> is the correct answer.</p><p><strong>Configuring your application to use the reader endpoint for both production traffic and reporting queries, which will enable your Aurora database to automatically perform load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas</strong> is incorrect because although it is true that a reader endpoint enables your Aurora database to automatically perform load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas, it is quite limited to doing read operations only. You still need to use a custom endpoint to load-balance the database connections based on the specified criteria.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>In your application, use the instance endpoint of your Aurora database to handle the incoming production traffic and use the cluster endpoint to handle reporting queries</strong> is incorrect because a cluster endpoint (also known as a writer endpoint) for an Aurora DB cluster simply connects to the current primary DB instance for that DB cluster. This endpoint can perform write operations in the database such as DDL statements, which is perfect for handling production traffic but not suitable for handling queries for reporting since there will be no write database operations that will be sent. Moreover, the endpoint does not point to lower-capacity or high-capacity instances as per the requirement. A better solution for this is to use a custom endpoint.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Do nothing since by default, Aurora will automatically direct the production traffic to your high-capacity instances and the reporting queries to your low-capacity instances</strong> is incorrect because Aurora does not do this by default.

By using this combination, you can store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using industry-standard file protocols such as Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB). The software appliance, or gateway, is deployed into your on-premises environment as a virtual machine (VM) running on VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, or Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor.</p><p><br></p><p><img src=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/storagegateway/latest/userguide/images/file-gateway-concepts-diagram.png\"></p><p><br></p><p>The gateway provides access to objects in S3 as files or file share mount points. With a file gateway, you can do the following:</p><p>- You can store and retrieve files directly using the NFS version 3 or 4.1 protocol.</p><p>- You can store and retrieve files directly using the SMB file system version, 2 and 3 protocol.</p><p>- You can access your data directly in Amazon S3 from any AWS Cloud application or service.</p><p>- You can manage your Amazon S3 data using lifecycle policies, cross-region replication, and versioning. You can think of a file gateway as a file system mount on S3.</p><p>AWS Storage Gateway supports the Amazon S3 Standard, Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access, Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access and Amazon Glacier storage classes. When you create or update a file share, you have the option to select a storage class for your objects. You can either choose the Amazon S3 Standard or any of the infrequent access storage classes such as S3 Standard IA or S3 One Zone IA. Objects stored in any of these storage classes can be transitioned to Amazon Glacier using a Lifecycle Policy.</p><p>Although you can write objects directly from a file share to the S3-Standard-IA or S3-One Zone-IA storage class, it is recommended that you use a Lifecycle Policy to transition your objects rather than write directly from the file share, especially if you're expecting to update or delete the object within 30 days of archiving it.</p><p>Therefore, the correct answer is: <strong><em>Launch a new file gateway that connects to your on-premises data center using AWS Storage Gateway. Upload the documents to the file gateway and set up a lifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for data archival.</em></strong></p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Launch a new tape gateway that connects to your on-premises data center using AWS Storage Gateway. Upload the documents to the tape gateway and set up a lifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for archival</em></strong> is incorrect because although tape gateways provide cost-effective and durable archive backup data in Amazon Glacier, it does not meet the criteria of being retrievable immediately within minutes. It also doesn't maintain a local cache that provides low latency access to the recently accessed data and reduce data egress charges. Thus, it is still better to set up a file gateway instead.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Establish a Direct Connect connection to integrate your on-premises network to your VPC. Upload the documents on Amazon EBS Volumes and use a lifecycle policy to automatically move the EBS snapshots to an S3 bucket, and then later to Glacier for archival</em></strong> is incorrect because EBS Volumes are not as durable compared with S3 and it would be more cost-efficient if you directly store the documents to an S3 bucket. An alternative solution is to use AWS Direct Connect with AWS Storage Gateway to create a connection for high-throughput workload needs, providing a dedicated network connection between your on-premises file gateway and AWS. But this solution is using EBS, hence, this option is still wrong.</p><p>The option that says: <strong><em>Use AWS Snowmobile to migrate all of the files from the on-premises network. Upload the documents to an S3 bucket and set up a lifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for archival</em></strong> is incorrect because Snowmobile is mainly used to migrate the entire data of an on-premises data center to AWS.

        "relatedLectureIds": "",
        "explanation": "<p>The partition key portion of a table's primary key determines the logical partitions in which a table's data is stored. This in turn affects the underlying physical partitions. Provisioned I/O capacity for the table is divided evenly among these physical partitions. Therefore a partition key design that doesn't distribute I/O requests evenly can create \"hot\" partitions that result in throttling and use your provisioned I/O capacity inefficiently.</p><p>The optimal usage of a table's provisioned throughput depends not only on the workload patterns of individual items, but also on the partition-key design. This doesn't mean that you must access all partition key values to achieve an efficient throughput level, or even that the percentage of accessed partition key values must be high. It does mean that the more distinct partition key values that your workload accesses, the more those requests will be spread across the partitioned space. In general, you will use your provisioned throughput more efficiently as the ratio of partition key values accessed to the total number of partition key values increases.</p><p>One example for this is the use of <strong>partition keys with high-cardinality attributes, which have a large number of distinct values for each item</strong>.</p><p><strong>Reducing the number of partition keys in the DynamoDB table</strong> is incorrect. Instead of doing this, you should actually add more to improve its performance to distribute the I/O requests evenly and not avoid \"hot\" partitions.</p><p><strong>Using partition keys with low-cardinality attributes, which have a few number of distinct values for each item</strong> is incorrect because this is the exact opposite of the correct answer. Remember that the more distinct partition key values your workload accesses, the more those requests will be spread across the partitioned space. Conversely, the less distinct partition key values, the less evenly spread it would be across the partitioned space, which effectively slows the performance.</p><p>The option that says: <strong>Avoid using a composite primary key, which is composed of a partition key and a sort key</strong> is incorrect because as mentioned, a composite primary key will provide more partition for the table and in turn, improves the performance.

To migrate file share configurations from your on-premises file system, you must migrate your files first to Amazon FSx before migrating your file share configuration.</p><p>Hence, the correct answer is: <strong>Migrate the existing file share configuration to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server</strong>.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Migrate the existing file share configuration to AWS Storage Gateway</strong> is incorrect because AWS Storage Gateway is primarily used to integrate your on-premises network to AWS but not for migrating your applications. Using a file share in Storage Gateway implies that you will still keep your on-premises systems, and not entirely migrate it.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Migrate the existing file share configuration to Amazon EFS</strong> is incorrect because it is stated in the scenario that the company is using a file share that runs on a Windows server. Remember that Amazon EFS only supports Linux workloads.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Migrate the existing file share configuration to Amazon EBS</strong> is incorrect because EBS is primarily used as block storage for EC2 instances and not as a shared file system. A file share is a specific folder in a file system that you can access using a server message block (SMB) protocol. Amazon EBS does not support SMB protocol.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/faqs/</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/migrate-file-share-config-to-fsx.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/migrate-file-share-config-to-fsx.html</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon FSx Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-fsx/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-fsx/</a></p>",

To store a file in Amazon S3, you upload it to a bucket. When you upload a file as an object, you can set permissions on the object and any metadata. Buckets are containers for objects. You can have one or more buckets. You can control access for each bucket, deciding who can create, delete, and list objects in it. You can also choose the geographical region where Amazon S3 will store the bucket and its contents and view access logs for the bucket and its objects.</p><p><img src=\"https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/images/lifecycle-transitions-v2.png \"></p><p>To move a file to a different storage class, you can use Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS. Both services have lifecycle configurations. Take note that Amazon EFS can only transition a file to the IA storage class after 90 days. Since you need to move the files that are older than 2 years to a more cost-effective and scalable solution, you should use the Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration. With S3 lifecycle rules, you can transition files to S3 Standard IA or S3 Glacier. Using S3 Glacier expedited retrieval, you can quickly access your files within 1-5 minutes.</p><p>Hence, the correct answers are:</p><p><strong>- Use Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy that will move the objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 2 years.</strong></p><p><strong>- Use Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy that will move the objects to Amazon S3 Standard-IA after 2 years.</strong></p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use Amazon EFS and create a lifecycle policy that will move the objects to Amazon EFS-IA after 2 years </strong>is incorrect because the maximum days for the EFS lifecycle policy is only 90 days. The requirement is to move the files that are older than 2 years or 730 days.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use Amazon EBS volumes to store the files. Configure the Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) to schedule snapshots of the volumes after 2 years</strong> is incorrect because Amazon EBS costs more and is not as scalable as Amazon S3. It has some limitations when accessed by multiple EC2 instances. There are also huge costs involved in using the multi-attach feature on a Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to allow multiple EC2 instances to access the volume.</p><p>The option that says:<strong> Use a RAID 0 storage configuration that stripes multiple Amazon EBS volumes together to store the files. Configure the Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) to schedule snapshots of the volumes after 2 years</strong> is incorrect because RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is just a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple storage devices to achieve higher performance or data durability. RAID 0 can stripe multiple volumes together for greater I/O performance than you can achieve with a single volume. On the other hand, RAID 1 can mirror two volumes together to achieve on-instance redundancy.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/lifecycle-management-efs.html\">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/lifecycle-management-efs.html</a></p><p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/\">https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Check out this Amazon S3 Cheat Sheet:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/?src=udemy\">https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-s3/</a></p>",
